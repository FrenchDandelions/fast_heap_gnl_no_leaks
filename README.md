I was mad that my heap gnl had still reachable blocks if called once, I still have to test it again tomorrow but from what a friend told me, it doesn't have any leaks yet.

I still have a few tests to run and to modify my structure for the bonus to add an int that will tell me if i'm inside the function or not to get rid of still reachables, but I'm close to my answer on this project.

Please, if you're new to the 42 school, do not use this gnl to pass the project, this is not how you use the destructor attribute. If anyone want to share ideas on how to improve it, I'm taking them with open arms!
