I was mad that my heap gnl had still reachable blocks if called once, so I fixed it.

It still timeout though but I can't make it faster (I'm too lazy to fix it more) to pass these tests. 

Please, if you're new to the 42 school, do not use this gnl to pass the project, this is not how you use the destructor attribute. If anyone want to share ideas on how to improve it, I'm taking them with open arms!
